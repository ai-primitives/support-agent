## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (In Progress)
- [x] Set up project structure and configuration
- [x] Implement core database schema
- [x] Create basic API endpoints with Hono
- [ ] Set up Vectorize index and basic RAG pipeline

### Phase 2: Core Functionality (Not Started)
- [ ] Implement message queue system
- [ ] Create basic chat processing logic
- [ ] Set up vector search and context retrieval
- [ ] Implement basic response generation

### Phase 3: Channel Integration (Not Started)
- [ ] Implement email routing and processing
- [ ] Create Slack app integration
- [ ] Develop chat widget component
- [ ] Set up channel-specific message handling

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Not Started)
- [ ] Implement business profile management
- [ ] Add persona configuration system
- [ ] Enhance RAG with multi-context support
- [ ] Add analytics and monitoring

### Phase 5: Polish & Optimization (Not Started)
- [ ] Implement caching strategies
- [ ] Add rate limiting and quotas
- [ ] Enhance error handling and recovery
- [ ] Optimize performance and resource usage

## Testing Strategy
- [x] Unit tests for core functionality
  - [x] Business API endpoints
  - [ ] Knowledge base operations
  - [ ] Persona management
- [ ] Integration tests for each channel
- [ ] Load testing for queue system
- [ ] End-to-end testing for complete flows
- [ ] Security testing for API endpoints

## Technical Challenges
1. Vectorize local bindings not supported in test environment
2. Worker initialization requires proper D1 database setup
3. Type definitions needed manual generation using wrangler

## Verification Status
- [x] Business API endpoints tested and verified
- [x] Database schema implemented and validated
- [x] Test environment configured and operational
- [ ] RAG pipeline pending implementation
- [ ] Channel integrations pending

## Deployment Status
- [x] Development environment configured
- [ ] Staging environment setup pending
- [ ] Production deployment plan needed
